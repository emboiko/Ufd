# Universal File Dialog

Import:
`from Ufd import Ufd`

Construct:
```
ufd = Ufd(
show_hidden=True,
include_files=True,
tree_xscroll=True
)

result = ufd()
```
Or
`ufd = Ufd(0,1,0)`
Or
`ufd = Ufd()`

Ufd still has several [boolean constructor parameters] options & behavioral tweaks in development that will optionally restrict / expand upon its behavior to match the context in which it is used.
